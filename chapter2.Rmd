#Regression and model validation

*This work has been a good introduction of using some of the handy commands from the dplyr library.*

The data consist of measurements and results from a set of people anwering questions about how they feel about statistics based on some categories of questions as well as taking an exam. The total dimension of the data is 183 observations and 60 variables. In this task we look closer at three categories of questions which all concist of a number of different subsets. These subsets are combined in R into three columns named "deep", "strategic" and "surface". After this we choose to look closer on 7 variables "gender","Age","Attitude", "deep", "stra", "surf", "Points" where points is the score from the exam. There are a few cases with people not showing up for the final exam leaving them a 0-mark under "Points". These observations are excluded leaving us with 166 observations and 7 variables. In the original dataset all the observations except the factor "gender" are integers but after the wrangling the combined dataset consist of also numerics when it comes to the means of the combined subsets.
